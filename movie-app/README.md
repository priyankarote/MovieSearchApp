To fulfill the assignment requirements for building a Movie Search App Prototype using React.js, let's break down the steps and code implementation. The app should have the following features:
A search bar to allow users to input movie titles.
A list of popular movies displayed by default.
Fetch movie data from the OMDb API.
A modal displaying additional details about a movie when clicked.
We'll build this step-by-step using React, Axios for making API calls, and basic CSS for styling.
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Set up React App
Install Dependencies
Create Components
MovieSearch: A component for searching movies.
MovieCard: A component to display individual movie details.
MovieModal: A modal to display detailed information about a selected movie.
Manage State using React's useState hook.
Fetch Data from the OMDb API using Axios.
Style the Components.
To start a React app, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up the React App
i)  Ensure Prerequisites
  Install Node.js (which includes npm): Download it from Node.js official website.
Verify installation:
bash

node -v
npm -v
ii) Now You can create the React app using create-react-app if it's not already set up.
bash

npx create-react-app movie-search-app

If npx isnâ€™t working, you might need to install it:
bash

npm install -g npx
iii) you can go to folder 
 bash
cd movie-search-app
npm install axios


Step 2: OMDb API Key
To interact with the OMDb API, you'll need an API key. Go to OMDb API and sign up for an API key. You can use the free tier for basic searches.

Step 3: Create Components
We'll create three components:
MovieSearch.js - The search bar and search results.
MovieCard.js - Display individual movie details (title, year).
MovieModal.js - Display detailed movie information in a modal.
MovieSearch.js
This component will include the search bar and will fetch results from the OMDb API.
\movie-app\src\Components\MovieSearch.js
2. MovieCard.js
This component will display basic movie information (title and year)
\movie-app\src\Components\MovieCard.js
3. MovieModal.js
This component will display additional details when a movie is clicked.
\movie-app\src\Components\MovieModal.js
Step 4: Basic CSS Styling
Here is the CSS to style the app, including the modal.
movie-app\src\App.css
Step 5: Run the App
Replace 'your_omdb_api_key' with your actual OMDb API key.
Run the app:
bash
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Now, your app should allow users to search for movies, display a list of results, and show detailed information about a movie when clicked
Deployment and Submission
Push your code to a GitHub repository:
bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
